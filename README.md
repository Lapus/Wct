Wct Editor is a fast and crossplatform machine code editor for numeric system Wct.

Advantages:

  - **Fast**
  - ***Small***
  - **Easy to use**
  - ***More readable, than Hex***
  - **Improves logic brain function**

:bulb: Wct editor is used in Stapler programming language and practically does
not differ from the Hex, but has a more advanced system of writing code.
Stable version stays 1.50.50, but you can use a newest versions, of course.

### Using

If you use Linux, just copy *wcteditor* to */usr/bin* folder, and you can use Wct Editor with following command:

```sh
$ wcteditor <source> [output]
```
*Example:*

```sh
$ mkdir test
$ cd test
$ wcteditor test.wct output
$ dir
test.wct output
$ ./output
```

### Development

You need to write a big program? Of course, you can do it, but *it's not worth it*!

Wct Editor created for the brain explosion & training, embedding programs into other programs, writing small programs (also for hacking), coding under retro pc (or coding any demos), exploring the wilds of the PC architecture and for easier understanding of what you are doing. But not for writing large programs! If you write a large program (more, than 1 MB), you may lose your mind. You can create own version of Wct Editor or use Wct number system in raw type (for embedded systems, languages, compilers, math, etc). Also, if you're crazy, Wct IDE is the best solution for you.

### Todo's

  - [x] Add Mac OS version
  - [ ] Write book about Wct
  - [x] Optimize speed
